## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- SCSS
- Webpack
- Typescript

### What I learned

- How to set up webpack to use it with **Typescript**, **SCSS**, **HTML**.
- Getting to terms with **Typescript** was quite the challenge given the _strict type checking_.

### Useful resources

- [Coder Coder's SCSS Tuts](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCoderCoder) - The SCSS tuts helped me quite the bit to figure out how to use SCSS optimally whilst styling HTML pages.
- [Brad Traversy's Webpack Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGNcSuwBZs&t=845s) - This small crash course helped me out to setup webpack. Did an additional research to iron out the details.

## Acknowledgments

- [This repo](https://github.com/elroytoscano/typescript-webpack) was extensively used for setting up the webpack config.
- [Coder coder's SCSS tuts](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCoderCoder) were quite useful for SCSS related queries.
